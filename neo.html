            <p class="definition">Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids or comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth. They are classified based on their orbital characteristics.</p>

                    <p>Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, primarily found in a region of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter called the asteroid belt. They are remnants from the early solar system, made up of materials that never formed into planets. Although they vary in size, most asteroids are much smaller than planets, and they can be irregularly shaped. Occasionally, asteroids can collide with planets or moons, potentially causing significant impacts.</p>

                    <p>Comets are icy bodies that release gas or dust. They are often referred to as "dirty snowballs" because of their icy and rocky composition. Comets have highly elliptical orbits, which bring them very close to the Sun and then take them far out into the solar system. As they approach the Sun, the heat causes their icy components to vaporize, forming a glowing coma and sometimes a tail that points away from the Sun. Comets can vary greatly in size, from a few kilometers to several tens of kilometers in diameter.</p>

                    <p>The term satellite refers to any object that orbits a larger object in space. There are two main types of satellites:
                        1. Natural Satellites: Celestial bodies that naturally orbit a planet or larger body. Moons are the most common example, such as Earth's Moon.
                        2. Artificial Satellites: Human-made objects placed into orbit around Earth or another celestial body. These are used for communication (TV and internet), weather monitoring (weather satellites), navigation (GPS), and scientific research (the Hubble Space Telescope).
                        Artificial satellites are launched by rockets and placed into specific orbits to perform their functions. Their orbits vary based on their purpose and can be at different altitudes and inclinations..</p>

                    <p>Moons,also known as natural satellites, are celestial bodies that orbit planets or dwarf planets. They vary widely in size, composition, and number across different planetary systems. Moons can be made of rock, metal, ice, or a combination of these materials, and they come in various shapes and sizes, from tiny asteroid-sized bodies to large moons like Earth's Moon, which is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system.
                        Moons can influence their parent planets in several ways, such as affecting tides (as Earth's Moon does) or contributing to the stability of the planet's rotation. Some planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, have dozens of moons, while others, like Mercury and Venus, have none. Moons can also be interesting scientifically, as some, like Jupiter's Europa or Saturn's Enceladus, are thought to have subsurface oceans that could potentially harbor life.
